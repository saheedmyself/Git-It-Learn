Hello Git

For real I am learning to use git.
I have used git before in Visual Studio with GitExt.
It felt fantastic, however,
Just like every other thing in my life right now I am
relearning everything.

This too is a relearn.

I am adding another line to test "diff"
Now it says "Changes not staged for commit" but Git-it says nothing about the error yet
